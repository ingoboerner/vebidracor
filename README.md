# VeBiDraCor â€“ Very Big Drama Corpus

For **VeBiDraCor** plays pubslished on [DraCor](https://dracor.org) have been assembled to a Very Big Drama Corpus containing some 2.900 plays. 

You can run a local instance of this corpus with docker `docker-compose up`. The database will have to reindex the file and starting the infrastructure will take some time, but ultimately, you can access it at http://localhost:8088
